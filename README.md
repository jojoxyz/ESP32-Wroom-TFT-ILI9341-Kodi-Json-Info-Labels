LCD Info panel for CoreElec or LibreElec. As an idea I used Kodi_panel (https://github.com/mattblovell/kodi_panel) in Python from the creator who did a good job but unfortunately it only works on RPI or on Odroid N2+ in coreElec version 9.2.3. On Odroid, newer versions it cannot be started because there is a problem with python and GPIO library and similar issues. My program is based on arduino esp32 and primarily intended for PVR but it has open options for displaying anything you want. I have TV Logos in PNG format 200x200 pixel and therefore this program can only work with PNG format. Part of the program for downloading PNG from IP addresses is taken from another creator (https://github.com/Bodmer/PNG_TEST_ONLY).

I'm not a pro, but it's functional and if someone doesn't like it, let them modify it according to their own ideas.
